# Legacy Modules

This folder contains historical/unused modules kept for reference.

They are **not imported** by the current EchoChat runtime (the server is built and wired in `server_init.py` and routes are registered via `routes_*.py`).

If you want to remove them entirely later, ensure nothing imports them, then delete this folder.
